== Description ==

### Soundcheck Plugin: Bring Voice to WordPress

The Soundcheck plugin for WordPress is the easiest way to publish web content that is optimized for voice devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home. The plugin integrates directly with the new Gutenberg editor to make adding speakable content as easy as point, click, and type. The plugin validates posts to check for for the correct speakable markup and lets your preview what voice assistants may dictate from your page. Finally, use copy from your voice-optimized website as spoken content for voice assistants, making WordPress a true CMS for voice.
