Reach a wider audience and attract voice consumers with "speakable" content. Soundcheck is the easiest way to publish web content for smart speakers.

== Description ==

### Soundcheck Plugin: Bring Voice to WordPress

Looking for a way to reach the growing number of people who rely on voice search for the latest news and information? As consumers initiate requests for news updates through voice devices, the responses have to be in voice too.

The Soundcheck plugin for WordPress is the easiest way to publish web content that is optimized for voice devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home. The plugin integrates directly with the new Gutenberg editor to make adding `speakable` content as easy as point, click, and type. The plugin validates posts to check for for the correct `speakable` markup and lets your preview what voice assistants may dictate from your page. Finally, use copy from your voice-optimized website as spoken content for voice assistants, making WordPress a true CMS for voice.

#### Introduction to Speakable Content

Google adopted an open schema.org specification called `speakable` to help the Google Assistant determine which content to read out loud. As​ ​[Google explains](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/speakable), "The speakable schema.org property identifies sections within an article or webpage that are best suited for audio playback using text-to-speech (TTS). Adding markup allows search engines and other applications to identify content to read aloud on Google Assistant-enabled devices using TTS."

#### "Speakable" Content Blocks

A custom Gutenberg block for adding `speakable` content to your posts.

* Include copy that is optimized for text-to-speech.
* Automatically generate the required structured data with no coding.

#### Validate and Preview

* Automatically check new posts for `speakable` content.
* Warn when content is not properly optimized for voice.
* Preview the voice-optimized content on any post.

### Speakable News

If you are a Google News Publisher or Producer, expand your reach to a wider voice audience. Add `speakable` content to news articles and let Google Home devices read it to users.

> "Hey Google, what's the latest news about $topic?"
> "Hey Google, play news about $topic." 

* Monitors when posts come up in Google News.
* Validates your posts to make sure they have eligible `speakable` content.
